Heart-Disease-Prediction-
A heart disease prediction uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze a patient's clinical data and predict their likelihood of having heart disease. These projects often use publicly available datasets (like the UCI Heart Disease Dataset) and a variety of ML models to build a predictive tool, often deployed as a web application.
